The ALX Project: Session Authentication
Session Authentication focuses on implementing secure user authentication using sessions. In web applications, authentication is a fundamental aspect of ensuring that users are who they claim to be. Session authentication provides a way to maintain user identity across multiple requests during a user's visit to a website or web application.

In this project, the goal is to implement session-based authentication to enhance the security and user experience of web applications; For instance, through various authentication methods and techniques, session management, and secure user login and logout functionalities.
